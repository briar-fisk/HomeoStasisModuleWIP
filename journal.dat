   Decided to do two tables for goal seeking parameters. One for single value goals and one with a range. This is so you can separate things that need fine tuning all the time from those who can be a little more lax.

   Implemented those tables.

   Adding settings, starting with adaptive vs fixed. Adaptive meaning it trains as it runs, and fixed means it is locked into the initial training set.

   Updated the update function to handle training vs prediction, and the setting_Adaptive_Or_Fixed

   Skeleton of the update_Prediction is outlined, working on implementing compile_Delta_Targets. Have to pack up for now so uploading progress.

   Oh yeah, added journal.bat so I can use it to keep track of these comments
